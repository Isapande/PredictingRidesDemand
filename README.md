# PredictingRidesDemand
Understanding ride demand for a ride-hailing service.

### Overview
This notebook is ideal for analyzing urban mobility trends, using spatial and temporal data to better understand transportation dynamics in a city. It explores ride patterns, visualizes trends, and runs regression models to identify factors influencing ride demand. The analysis leverages Python libraries for geospatial data processing, visualization, and statistical modeling.

### Libraries Used
	osmnx: To retrieve neighborhood boundary data from OpenStreetMap.
	geopandas: For geospatial operations and plotting neighborhoods.
	matplotlib and contextily: For creating maps and overlaying spatial data on basemaps.
	pandas: For data manipulation and processing.
	shapely: For handling geometric objects such as points representing ride locations.
	ipywidgets: To create interactive widgets for time window selection and scenario analysis.
	geopy: For calculating distances between ride start and end points.
